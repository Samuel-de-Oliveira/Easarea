# Easarea - A area cacalator software

This software is created for leaning pruposes, thats mean it's not
a super profetional program to use to do perfect things, but you can
install it if you want to test. For while this software is on a BETA
version

### Okay but... How I can install it?

If you use Linux or MacOS you can use this command:

	sudo make install

but if you want to compile only you can write:

	make

For while don't have a Windows version of installer, you can compile
and install for yourself in this case.
